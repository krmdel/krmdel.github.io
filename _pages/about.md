<p style="text-align: justify !important;">
I'm recently a machine learning researcher at TUMCREATE in Singapore and a Ph.D. candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). I'm passionate about building intelligent systems that uncover the mysteries of life, bridging scientific discoveries with real-world impact. My work lies at the intersection of healthcare, computer vision and Gen AI, developing advanced computer vision pipelines for real-time, high-throughput medical imaging, and combining analytical AI with agentic AI to reveal hidden data patterns through multi-agent reasoning and automated grounding. I've published in high-impact journals and conferences and hold several issued and pending patents in computer vision, agentic AI, and biomedical imaging. Beyond research, I'm deeply motivated by the entrepreneurial and economic potential of AI and fascinated by how it will transform our world and society in the near future. Always open to new perspectives. Feel free to reach out!
